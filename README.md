# FDA-Adverse-Reactions


In this project, I take retrieve data from the FDA's API about adverse reactions to drugs to analyze.



## Introduction and Goals

A. Gathering the Data from the FDA about Drug Adverse Reactions

      1. Use openFDA API 

 

B. Analyze these findings to see

      1. What trends do we see in reporting

      2. What information can we get about drug manufacturers

      are some producing more adverse reaction reports than others?

      are there trends for different manufacturers?

      are some manufacturers more responsible for the overall trends we see in 
       reporting than others

      3. If we can accurately predict whether a reaction will be serious or not given various 
          predictors

      4. Forecast the number of serious and non-serious adverse reactions five years into 
          the future
